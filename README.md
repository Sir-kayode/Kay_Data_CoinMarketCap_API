Project Name:  Kay_Data_CoinMarketCap_API

Time Line April 10, 2023 to April 16, 2023

Introduction: This is a Python program that retrieves data from CoinMarketCap via their API. It allows users to view real-time data on cryptocurrency prices, market caps, and other relevant information.

Requirements: This program requires Python 3.x, as well as the requests libraries. You can install these libraries by running the following command:
pip install requests

Installation: To install this program, simply clone this repository to your local machine:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coinmarketcap-api-python.git. 
Then, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and install the dependencies:pip install requests.

Configuration: To connect to the CoinMarketCap API, you will need an API key. You can obtain a key by signing up for an account on the CoinMarketCap website.

Once you have your API key, create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project and add the following line: API_KEY=your_api_key_here
This will allow your program to access the API using your personal key.

Usage: To use this program, simply run the `main.py` script from the command line:python MainKDCAPI.py
This will retrieve the latest data from CoinMarketCap and display it in the terminal.

Examples: Here are some examples of how to use this program:
MainKDCAPI.py --limit 10
This will retrieve data for the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.
MainKDCAPI.py --convert EUR
This will retrieve data in Euros instead of US dollars.
MainKDCAPI.py --sort rank
This will sort the data by rank instead of by market cap.
